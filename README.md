🦷 # Cold Calling Automation for Dental Clinics

This project is a cold calling automation system designed specifically for dental clinics. 
It helps clinics automatically follow up with patients who had an initial appointment but haven't scheduled a second one yet.

🚀 # How It Works

Patient data (name, phone number, treatment, etc.) is entered into a Google Sheets file.

Using Make (formerly Integromat), the data is fetched and processed.

The data is sent to a virtual assistant on Retell AI.

The assistant automatically calls the patient and says something like:

“Hi, I’m calling from [Clinic Name]. Am I speak with {Name}?"
Would you like to schedule a second appointment to continue your treatment?”

If the patient confirms, a new appointment can be booked or the clinic is notified.
